Hello {firstName}, <br>
<br>
Good morning! <br>
<br>
I hope all is well. My name is Amey and it is wonderful to connect with you last time. I applied to a few positions within {companyName}. <br>
<br>
I am reaching out to you because while I understand you may not be the hiring manager or connected to the position, <br>
<br>
I was wondering if there was a way my credentials can be seen by someone connected to the position. <br>
<br>
Confidentiality is understood so if you are not at liberty to give me the information to the person connected to the role, <br>
is there some way that you can share my LinkedIn profile with some of your colleagues?
<br>
Your time is valuable and I understand if you don’t have the bandwidth. I’ve been consistently applying to the {companyName} and I’m hoping to be noticed soon. <br>
<br>
Thank you for taking the time to consider my request. Have an amazing rest of the day. <br>
